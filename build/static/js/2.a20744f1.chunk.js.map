Every article of clothing that has gotten its way\n          into our hands has its own story, but chances are it was most likely\n          made by impoverished people in developing countries, such as\n          Bangladesh. Many of these workers, in fact, are actually children as\n          young as ten who work long hours in poor working conditions for low\n          wages. Unfortunately, child labor is a particularly common practice\n          within Bangladesh’s expansive textile and garments manufacturing\n          industry – which has steadily gained international recognition as one\n          of the largest garments exporters and distributors in the world.” 1\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          As Bangladesh struggles with a growing demand for more jobs due to\n          overpopulation – which is only projected to increase to nearly 185\n          million by 2030, its garments industry has served a valuable role in\n          employing more than 25 million people, most of whom are women and\n          young children from poor families.2 Nevertheless, this financial\n          stability does not justify the exploitation of children in garment\n          factories. According to a 2016 study conducted by the Overseas\n          Development Institute, “children as young as six employed full time\n          and others working up to 100 to 110 hours a week … [earned] on average\n          less than $2 a day.”3\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          But what leads children in Bangladesh to work in garments factories?\n          The answer lies within a larger issue – poverty. Due to the “absence\n          of living wages, adequate social protection schemes, lack of\n          opportunities to access education and prevailing social norms” many\n          children are pressured to work in these factories at a young age –\n          especially those whose parents are already garments factory workers.\n          Working in garment factories is one of the few ways poor children in\n          Bangladesh can contribute to supporting themselves and their families\n          which, in turn, negatively impacts their quality of education and\n          prevents them from continuing school. Children employed in\n          Bangladesh’s many sprawling garments factories, or rather\n          “sweatshops,” engage in various kinds of jobs ranging from operating\n          clothes machines to\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"wStyle\">\n          Sources used:\n          <br />\n          1 UNICEF “The Ready Made Garment Sector and Children in Bangladesh”\n          <br />\n          2 UNICEF “The Ready Made Garment Sector and Children in Bangladesh”\n          <br />\n          3 Beaubien, Jason. “Study: Child Laborers in Bangladesh Are Working 64\n          Hours A Week”\n          <br />4 UNICEF “The Ready Made Garment Sector and Children in\n          Bangladesh”\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport { content };\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
