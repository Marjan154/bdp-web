The population being exposed to the arsenic-contaminated groundwater is at an all time high and requires immediate attention/action. The civilians of Bangladesh have no other option but to drink the potentially contaminated groundwater, which raises major health concerns. There have been reports over time of individuals affected by arsenic in Bangladesh and surrounding areas. It has been discovered that the arsenic contamination is extremely high in the tube-wells, which is where majority of the population retrieve their water. Arsenic in groundwater poses a huge threat to the lives of millions in Bangladesh."),c.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"Attached below is a table breaking down the different regions of Bangladesh and how they compare to containing arsenic contaminants in groundwater. Contamination of drinking-water by arsenic in Bangladesh: a public health emergency. As you can see here, arsenic in groundwater is dominant in many regions of Bangladesh out of the samples surveyed. This issue is being brought to light as of recently due to the significant use of tube-wells by most of the Bangladeshi population. The effects of arsenic are major and cause life-threatening complications. These include (but are not limited to) skin lesions, skin cancer, pulmonary disease, etc. There have also been reports of a small number of cases of skin cancer, which may lead to a rapid increase if arsenic levels aren\u2019t managed. Tube-wells have been used for over decades and continue to be used by the majority. The lack of awareness should not be the cause of millions of individuals being affected on a daily basis."),c.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"There should be increased urgency and action taken against the high concentrations of arsenic in groundwater. The mitigation of arsenic exposure is fairly straightforward, however the lack of funding makes this an increasingly difficult problem to solve.
