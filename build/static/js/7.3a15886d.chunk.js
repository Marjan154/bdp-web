The net enrollment rate at primary school level is said to have increased from 80 percent in 2000 to 98 percent in 2015, and secondary school net enrollment is now around 54 percent, up from 45 percent in 2000. On the other hand, the percentage of children completing primary school is close to 80 percent.However, approximately five million Bangladeshi children between the ages of six and 13 specifically from poor families, urban slums, and rural areas choose to work and provide for the family instead of getting an education given the crude poverty that they experience. Even though gender parity is also achieved in terms of education access, disparity still remains, especially in hard to reach rural areas where specifically females are heavily discouraged from receiving any form of education.Cultural beliefs of viewing women as inferiors or being limited only to household arena result in many young girls confined within the houses before or after their marriages or receiving only partial religious education in institutions called Madrasha. Many students also drop out of schools or colleges in order to handle the financial responsibility of the family. As a result, Bangladesh\u2019s workforce of 87 million is reported to be largely undereducated with only 4 percent of workers having higher than secondary education."),c.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"Although the government, along with many nonprofit organizations, particularly one named BRAC, is working to ensure that no child is left behind from the lights of education, the dream of universal education is still far from being accomplished. In order to ensure widespread access to public education, more schools are needed to be built, along with the recruitment of more teachers who can plant the seed of knowledge among the young and those who are left to dire poverty. As per data, spending on education accounts for 14.4% of the national budget, which corresponds to 2% of GDP. Given that many are still without education it is necessary that more be spent on the education sector."),c.a.createElement("div",{className:"wStyle"},"Sources used:",c.a.createElement("br",null),"\u201cBangladesh: Ensuring Education for All Bangladeshis.\u201d World Bank, projects-beta.worldbank.org/en/results/2016/10/07/ensuring-education-for-all-bangladeshis.",c.a.createElement("br",null),"\u201cEducation in Bangladesh.\u201d Education in Bangladesh | Global Partnership for Education, www.globalpartnership.org/country/bangladesh.",c.a.createElement("br",null),'"Health Policy in Bangladesh."
