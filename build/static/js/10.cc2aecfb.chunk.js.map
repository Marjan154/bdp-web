The rivers are instrumental in\n          providing water to grow crops in Bangladesh. However, these waters can\n          be contaminated by heavy metals leaching from man-made industrial\n          processes in Bangladesh. Heavy metals are those metals of high\n          densities and atomic masses (an atomic mass unit is equivalent to\n          one-twelfth the mass of a Carbon-12 atom). As a result, humans and\n          animals situated in Bangladesh can accumulate those heavy metals by\n          consumption of water and agricultural products containing those heavy\n          metals.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Trace amounts of heavy metals are needed for physiological and\n          physical processes helping humans and animals to maintain homeostasis\n          (the state of normalcy and maximum stability in organisms for\n          survival). Increased concentrations of heavy metals in living\n          organisms beyond trace amounts can lead to negative health effects and\n          disruption of homeostasis. This essay covers very briefly the history\n          of heavy metal detection in Bangladesh and possible health effects of\n          those heavy metals. In their official website, World Health\n          Organization (WHO) suggests various limits on concentrations of heavy\n          metals in water supplies for safe consumption of water. In Bangladesh,\n          measured water Arsenic of concentrations 500 µg/L and 100 µg/L\n          exceeded the WHO’s water Arsenic limit of 10 µg/L (Loewenberg, 2016).\n          In addition, Karnaphuli River of Bangladesh was found to have\n          concentrations of Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, and Lead exceeding the\n          limits set by WHO (Ali et al, 2016). The lead concentrations in some\n          crustacean and fish species from Saint Martin in Bangladesh were in\n          the carcinogenic ranges (Baki et al, 2018). Across the Karnaphuli\n          River and the adjacent coastal areas of Chittagong are the “hotspots”\n          containing high polluting concentrations of heavy metals (Kibria et\n          al, 2018). Prawn samples from Southeast Bangladesh contained mercury\n          and lead with concentrations exceeding max accepted levels specified\n          by WHO (Islam et al, 2017). Arsenic concentrations exceeded the\n          minimum WHO limits in shallow aquifers of Kushtia, Bangladesh (Huq et\n          al, 2019).\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Arsenic has been found to inhibit childhood intelligence by decreasing\n          working memory of infants (Wasserman et al, 2016). Arsenic is a\n          transition heavy metal and so it can bind to various chemicals that\n          are important to running and regulating metabolic pathways keeping an\n          organism alive (Mundy, 2015). In addition, Arsenic has the tendency to\n          manipulate genetic information which is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of\n          any living organism by introducing mutations (Mass et al 2001; Wang et\n          al, 2002). Chromium ions in waters stemming from tanneries of\n          Hazaribagh, Dhaka, were found to be “synergistically” carcinogenic\n          (cancer-causing) (Yoshinaga et al, 2018). High doses of cadmium can\n          cause kidney failure and softening of bones (Vannoort & Thomson, 2006)\n          in addition to prostate cancer (Gray et al, 2005). Neurodevelopment of\n          Bangladeshi children of 2-3 years old can be hampered by increased\n          blood lead concentrations stemming from drinking lead contaminated\n          water (Rodrigues et al, 2016).\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Excess amounts of arsenic in water have now become a debilitating\n          problem for the civilians of Bangladesh. The population being exposed\n          to the arsenic-contaminated groundwater is at an all time high and\n          requires immediate attention/action. The civilians of Bangladesh have\n          no other option but to drink the potentially contaminated groundwater,\n          which raises major health concerns. There have been reports over time\n          of individuals affected by arsenic in Bangladesh and surrounding\n          areas. It has been discovered that the arsenic contamination is\n          extremely high in the tube-wells, which is where majority of the\n          population retrieve their water. Arsenic in groundwater poses a huge\n          threat to the lives of millions in Bangladesh.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          The measurements of high concentrations of heavy metals in Bangladesh\n          waters when seen in conjunction with the health effects of them is\n          apparent from the discussion above. Clearly, this discussion suggests\n          the need for methodologies aiming to remove these heavy metals from\n          waters and to answer that issue there is research going on now to this\n          day on removing those heavy metals. In addition, research goes on to\n          this day looking for cheap and efficacious methods for removing those\n          heavy metals from contaminated Bangladesh waters.\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"wStyle\">\n          References\n          <ol>\n            <blockquote>\n              Loewenberg, S.
