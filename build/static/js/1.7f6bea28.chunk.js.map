Children\n          of ages from 5-14 years old are being put into tedious, unescapable\n          jobs. Most of the jobs that these children are put into often have\n          hazardous and unsafe conditions. Additionally this labor is forced\n          upon them. On top of this, these cases of forced labor are illegal and\n          are under little to no supervision.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          There are various types of work that children in Bangladesh are forced\n          or put into. Agriculture is one example of fields that the kids are\n          put into and this includes farming, which includes harvesting crops\n          like tobacco, and drying or processing fish. Another field that the\n          children are forced into is industry. This type of work includes cruel\n          labor such as mining, producing garments, brick breaking and even\n          welding. In industrial work, children are also put in dangerous\n          conditions, such as exposure to formaldehyde and other types of\n          hazardous chemicals. Other types of hard labor consists of pulling\n          rickshaws and domestic work in employer’s houses. Children are forced\n          to do this cruel labor for as many as 16 hours a day while only\n          getting paid less than $2 a day.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          The worst forms of child labor in Bangladesh includes smuggling and\n          selling drugs and even commercial sexual exploitation. According to\n          the “U.S Department of Labor”, the Rohingya ethnic minority are mostly\n          targeted in this forced labor. All the displaced Rohingya children\n          fleeing Burma due to ethnic cleansing, are forced into these forms of\n          forced labor. Most Rohingya boys work on farms or construction, but\n          young Rohingya girls are forced to work in Bangladeshi homes near\n          their camps. However some are tricked into forced commercial sexual\n          exploitation. To make matters worse, these refugees are prohibited\n          from attending school in Bangladesh due to “lack of documentation”.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          A lot of the reasons why these issues of forced labor are not being\n          solved is due to the lack of supervision on these industries where\n          children are being put to work illegally. The labor laws put in place\n          to prevent this sort of forced child labor are widely ignored and the\n          government does not have any officials or inspectors to supervise.\n          Most of this labor is off the books as well so it is hard to monitor\n          the legality of the work being done. Forced and cruel child labor can\n          be solved if the following things are done: 1. Everyone needs to raise\n          awareness of these issues since most are not aware of this lucrative\n          forced labor 2. The government needs to put in place inspectors and\n          officials to supervise the conditions of these industries and crack\n          down on illegal, off the books forced labor. Only then will this issue\n          be resolved and the children live the carefree life they deserve.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"wStyle\">\n          Sources used:\n          <br />\n          https://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-bangladesh-ships-20160309-story.html\n          <br />\n          https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/DossierPresse-UK-02.pdf\n          <br />\n          https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/Is-There-Child-Labor-in-Shipbreaking-Yards-2014-08-05\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport { content };\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
