This industry attracts many young and poor laborers who have no previous work experience, are underage, and live in poverty. Many factors influenced underage children to find work in Chittagong, the shipbreaking industry\u2019s hub. Some includes the child\u2019s father passing away or losing their job and/or their house being lost because of river erosion. These tragic circumstances give these children no choice but to work in these dangerous conditions and provide for their families. Shumon, an underage worker, describes his harsh reality and many other children in \u201cme and my brother still struggle to meet the needs of the family.

Even after the law banning underage laborers, it\u2019s still estimated that 20-25% of shipbreaking workers are children. To ensure that underage laborers aren\u2019t detected, they are often hired informally and are assigned to work at night."),l.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"Hazardous conditions lead to many injuries and even deaths within the industry. Most children are assigned to removing scrap parts from the mud, shaving down steel plates, remove fittings from inside ships, climb into tanks to clean them out, carry around heavy gas cylinders, moving parts of the ship like chains and cables, or relocating other heavy pieces of ship to trucks. These are children under 18, sometimes even 8 or 9 years old, handling sharp and dangerous objects to provide for their families. These children are subject to even more injuries because oftentimes, they receive no proper training or protective equipment. They are exposed to many possibilities of explosions and accidents due to the excruciating heat and unregulated safety. In Shashank Bengali\u2019s article \u201cAdult and underage workers risk their lives in Bangladesh's rising ship-breaking industry,\u201d he mentions 17 year old worker Mohammed Shujan Islam, who describes his labor as a \u201cvery hard job\u201d and only earning \u201c$3 a day\u201d but only doing it help feed his family (Bengali 1). Another incident accounted by Jowel, a 14 year old cutter helper, says \u201cRegularly, I can\u2019t eat anything because I have swallowed too much fume. When you have gas inside your body, you can\u2019t eat. My eyes are crying. When I come back to my room, often I can\u2019t eat because of the strong pain.\u201d These examples exemplify how these exploited children work 12-16 hours a day in life threatening conditions only to make little money."),l.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"Many children have to resort to working in harmful conditions like the shipbreaking industry to provide for their families. Child labor is still so prevalent in Bangladesh, especially within poor communities because children need to help their families that recently lost their houses in river erosion or if they lost the main provider of the family.
