This cultural practice is just an unjust and undercover way for men to receive sex, much like with prostitutes in these slum areas, the brides can be young, but are also sometimes much younger. Why would men be interested in such an act? Simply put, they are pedophiles. In Bangladesh, early marriage and child brides were always largely practiced despite it being illegal, however on March 1 st , 2017 the Bangladeshi Parliament passed a law which basically allowed child marriage under special circumstances under The Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. This makes suitors and buyers psychologically think that they are not doing anything wrong. According to Unicef, Bangladesh has the fourth highest child marriage rates in the world. Child brides are sexually abused almost daily for the pleasure of full grown men whom are twice or triple times the bride\u2019s size and the bride\u2019s age."),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"Reasons why this may be a cultural practice other than the fact that the suitors or buyers being allowed to pay money to commit pedophilic acts, it is because these families come from very low class and penury backgrounds which limits the possibilities for them as well as their offspring. School and access to education is not an option so young boys are sent or sold off to work, and young girls are sold off as prostitutes or are married off to grown men. The bride\u2019s families usually receive bride price for their daughters. Bride price is what the bride is worth in terms of money and other items such as jewelry."),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"Causes of child brides and early marriages include domestic violence, sexual abuse, pedophilia, low literacy rates, poverty, dowry, cultural pressures, and the hinderance of getting to actually work or have a career. These are also the causes of a lack of education/access to education. Domestic violence and rape can stem from these situations that leave the girls in a very vulnerable place. These men who marry young girls are given a chance to fulfil their fantasies and without remorse they forcefully adjust themselves into the bride\u2019s life and sexual abuse stems from this."),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"These events lead up to long-lasting trauma starting from an early age where these girls\u2019 childhoods are stripped away from them. Statistics show that over 60% of girls from rural and slum areas are being married off as child brides. In 2005, the percentage girls under the age of 15 being married off was around 30% and in 2015 the percentage of girls under the age of 18 being married off was almost 70%. Currently in 2019, the rates remain at an equilibrium since 2015 with the rates fluctuating but it is our mission to significantly reduce that. In order for everything to be changed for the better, the act of child brides and early marriages must be banned. Pedophilia in early marriages must be shamed and against the law. Girls need resources, education, access to healthcare and support from their families and well as their communities to fully prosper in life and provide for their families. We must give them access to education and other necessities so that they may have a list of possibilities."),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"wStyle"},"Human Rights Watch. \u201cBangladesh: Girls Damaged by Child Marriage.\u201d Human Rights Watch, 1 July 2015 Girls Not Brides. \u201cBangladesh Votes for Child Marriage Restraint Act \u2013 Girls Not Brides Bangladesh Reacts.\u201d Girls Not Brides, 1 Mar. 2017 HumanRightsWatch. \u201cEpidemic of Child Marriage in Bangladesh.\u201d YouTube, YouTube, 8 June 2015, www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJk6M5LgCg."))}}]),a}(l.Component))}}]);
