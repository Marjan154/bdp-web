In fact, Daulatdia, which is 100km west of the capital of\n          Bangladesh, is known to be a brothel-district and has been called one\n          of the biggest brothels in the world. It is an entire village that is\n          centered around prostitution. The second largest brothel in Bangladesh\n          is the Tangail District Brothel. The sex workers in these brothels\n          are, more often than not, very young girls from the age of 10 and they\n          all have one thing in common: extremely poor social and financial\n          conditions.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Despite the fact that Bangladesh is a secular nation, it is also a\n          predominantly Islamic country and these brothels operate on thin ice\n          amongst the Muslim society. Bangladesh is one of few Muslim countries\n          where prostitution is legal. What does this entail? The workers and\n          the buyers are vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases such as\n          AIDs and STDs, the literacy rate stays in equilibrium or in some cases\n          decline, early pregnancy may occur, and lastly self-esteem and\n          self-confidence may deplete. Some of the sex workers may even be given\n          steroids or other drugs to make them seem much more full-figured and\n          volumptuous, so they can appeal to the male gaze. Young girls get sold\n          off are trafficked to men who are double or more than triple their\n          age. For a child to be stripped away of their childhood and thrown\n          into a brothel is worrisome. Someone who could ideally be a father and\n          take away these children’s innocence is beyond a call for help and is\n          a sign of a state of emergency.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Most of the women in the Daulatdia and Tangail districts cannot afford\n          food or other necessities for themselves and their children, so they\n          resort to sending their young sons to work and exploit themselves as\n          well as their daughters to those who are willing to pay for sex. This\n          can only provide them the basic necessities, but cannot afford the\n          cost of school, therefore a lot of sex workers are illiterate. Over\n          1,000 enslaved, young, or abandoned women traffic themselves in the\n          Daulatdia district. We owe the children and women of Bangladesh so\n          much more than investing in a field of work that harms their physical\n          and mental well-being.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Hope is in high demand but in short supply with many of the young sex\n          workers in these slums. The prevalence of brothels in Bangladesh is\n          unfortunately much too lucrative for thousands in the area and it\n          should not have to be this way. No one needs to empathize to logically\n          see that there must be reform. With education, reform and with\n          out-pouring support, many of the girls may find themselves out of this\n          situation.\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"wStyle\">\n          Works Cited\n          <br />\n          “UN Team Visit Tangail Brothel as a Part of the 16 Days of Activism\n          Campaign against Gender-Based Violence.” UNFPA Bangladesh | UN Team\n          Visit Tangail Brothel as a Part of the 16 Days of Activism Campaign\n          against Gender-Based Violence, United Nations Population Fund, 24 Dec.\n          2018,\n          bangladesh.unfpa.org/en/news/un-team-visit-tangail-brothel-part-16-days-activism-campaign-against-gender-based-violence.\n          <br />\n          Buncombe, Andrew. “Independent Appeal: Sex Workers Dicing with Death\n          in Bangladesh.” The Independent, Independent Digital News and Media,\n          23 Oct. 2011,\n          www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/independent-appeal-sex-workers-dicing-with-death-in-bangladesh-1216245.html.\n          <br />\n          Joan M.
