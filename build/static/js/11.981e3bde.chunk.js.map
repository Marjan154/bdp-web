In\n          Bangladesh, there are many cases where patients have died from\n          consuming the wrong medicine, which were prescribed to them by the\n          doctor. Certain deaths could have been prevented if they were treated\n          with proper care and respect in the hospital.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Over the last couple of years, medical negligence has been a common\n          trend present in all the hospitals. Multiple claims have been made by\n          families of their deceased family members. For example, a first year\n          student in the Zoology department from Dhaka University, named Afia\n          Akter Chaity, had died in the hospital due to an error in identifying\n          the main cause of her sickness. In 2018, she was diagnosed with Acute\n          Myeloid (Myeloblastic) Leukemia, which is a cancer of the blood and\n          bone marrow, acute meaning it occurs rapidly. However, despite the\n          analysis proving the same diagnostic, doctors said she was suffering\n          from Dengue, a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. An article in\n          the Dhaka Tribune stated, “...Sometimes the doctors refused to share\n          information about the patient with their family members, which can\n          lead to wrong treatment.” Doctors don't always tell the truth to the\n          patient's family so they can prescribe the wrong medicine on purpose.\n          A hospital is supposed to help people recover from their sickness or\n          find the main source of their illness but multiple patients are being\n          harmed or even killed due to the wrong treatment.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Since people are given the wrong treatment and medicine, The\n          Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) has created six\n          international standard mini-labs to make sure fake medicine aren't\n          being given out and to lower the number of medical mishaps. Within\n          three hours, the administration can verify if the medicine is good\n          quality. This is better than labs, which takes several weeks to figure\n          out its components. It’s present in areas such as Rangpur, Dhaka,\n          Chattogram, Barisal, Rajshahi and Khulna. They are trying to spread\n          out and help lower the number of deaths.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          From October 2008 to February 2016, more than 500 people had died from\n          medical accidents. Another similar case occurred in 2011 with an eight\n          month old baby, the baby remains nameless. His dad, Mustafiz (not his\n          real name), took the baby to the United Hospital and later he was\n          placed in an intensive care unit. Mustafiz was told that his child was\n          suffering from pneumonia, so they shifted his kid to a normal room; he\n          was put under the ventilator for eighteen days. After twenty-one days,\n          his baby died and the doctors didn't release any information about the\n          cause of the death. After this incident, Dhaka Tribune said, Mustafiz\n          created a group on Facebook called “Blacklist Doctors.” Multiple\n          people wrote a countless numbers of doctors names who used wrong\n          treatments or their practice resulted in the patients' deaths.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          These deaths have made people question whether or not they should go\n          to the hospital. Usually when people go to treat their illness, they\n          get a wrong treatment in Bangladesh and when they travel to a hospital\n          in another country, they are told that they didn't need to do a\n          certain action. For example, in the Dhaka Tribune, Afrose Jahan Chaity\n          said, “In fiscal year 2015-16, India saw 460,000 inbound patients at\n          its different hospitals,...165,000 were from Bangladesh.\n          Interestingly, only around 58,000 medical visas were issued to\n          Bangladeshi nationals then, the survey reveals” (Chaity). Usually\n          patients would be confused on what to do and have no trust in\n          Bangladeshi doctors so they relied heavily on hospitals in other\n          countries. Another example is from 2001, Suraiaya Begum, found a\n          tumour present in her back. When she went to a hospital in Dhaka, they\n          removed her left ovary. However, when she went to Kolkata, a doctor\n          had informed her that removing her ovary was unnecessary and she\n          could've have better treatment. People tend to not trust Bangladesh\n          hospitals for their misleading treatments and because doctors choose\n          not to explore better options that would benefit the patients.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Bangladesh is trying to improve their hospital records. They have\n          taken measures to check the quality of all the medicine to make sure\n          they are safe. Medical mishaps cases have a huge record in Bangladesh\n          and the government is updating their system by changing their old\n          ways.\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"wStyle\">\n          Sources used:\n          <br />\n          https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/special/2018/01/27/will-medical-professionals-bangladesh-receive-immunity\n          <br />\n          https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/health-wellness/2017/11/30/doctor-trust-bangladesh\n          <br />\n          https://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/news/minilabs-six-districts-1683232\n          <br />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport { content };\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
