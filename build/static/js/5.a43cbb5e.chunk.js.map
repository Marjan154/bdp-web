This is no exception within\n          Bangladesh, which ranks as one of the top countries in the world with\n          the highest rates of early child marriages. According to 2017\n          estimates, nearly 71% of rural girls are married before age 18\n          compared with 54% of young girls from urban regions who are also\n          married despite being underage. 1 Child marriage is not just connected\n          to cultural norms but also other related underlying problems and\n          behaviors that are often ignored in Bangladeshi society – particularly\n          the “hidden” issue of pedophilia.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Numerous cases of pedophilia and sexual abuse against children are\n          reported in Bangladeshi news media. Last month, the Dhaka Tribune\n          reported a case of a 20-year-old man from Madhupur who coaxed a\n          7-year-old girl to his home and tried raping her but was ultimately\n          unsuccessful upon the girl’s fortunate rescue from nearby neighbors\n          who heard her cries.2 Just as recent as last week, two more atrocious\n          cases of rape were revealed in which the perpetrators were also\n          pedophiles; in the first, two young teenage girls were abducted and\n          raped by older men in Naranyanganj and in the latter case a\n          12-year-old sixth grader was raped by two older men more than twice\n          her age. The ill behavior of pedophiles can be linked to their\n          feelings of entitlement to sex, wanting to feel more masculine and\n          dominant, and their desire to have their sexual needs met by someone\n          deemed weak, subordinate, and easy to manipulate.3\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Although these cases have been reported, a significantly larger amount\n          of child sexual abuse cases that involve pedophiles are not brought to\n          the attention of authorities due to various reasons such as lack of\n          trust in the legal system, time consuming and high costs of taking\n          legal action, and families simply preferring to avoid negative stigma\n          from the public.4 Such cases are also “underreported largely due to\n          the fact that children do not fully understand their traumas, and the\n          perpetrator is often a close family friend or relative.”5\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"wStyle\">\n          Sources used:\n          <br />\n          1 UCA News, “Child brides, a cover for cultural pedophilia”\n          <br />\n          2 Al Numan, Abdullah.
