This industry attracts many young and poor\n          laborers who have no previous work experience, are underage, and live\n          in poverty. Many factors influenced underage children to find work in\n          Chittagong, the shipbreaking industry’s hub. Some includes the child’s\n          father passing away or losing their job and/or their house being lost\n          because of river erosion. These tragic circumstances give these\n          children no choice but to work in these dangerous conditions and\n          provide for their families. Shumon, an underage worker, describes his\n          harsh reality and many other children in “me and my brother still\n          struggle to meet the needs of the family. We cannot save a single\n          penny from our income. I dream of leading a happy life in the village.\n          I want to go back to my home. I miss my village a lot” (Laursen 1).\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Although new laws and regulations were passed in 2010 to ensure that\n          no one under the age of 18 worked in these risky environments, the\n          laws weren’t strictly implemented and underage children were still\n          able to work freely. Even after the law banning underage laborers,\n          it’s still estimated that 20-25% of shipbreaking workers are children.\n          To ensure that underage laborers aren’t detected, they are often hired\n          informally and are assigned to work at night.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Hazardous conditions lead to many injuries and even deaths within the\n          industry. Most children are assigned to removing scrap parts from the\n          mud, shaving down steel plates, remove fittings from inside ships,\n          climb into tanks to clean them out, carry around heavy gas cylinders,\n          moving parts of the ship like chains and cables, or relocating other\n          heavy pieces of ship to trucks. These are children under 18, sometimes\n          even 8 or 9 years old, handling sharp and dangerous objects to provide\n          for their families. These children are subject to even more injuries\n          because oftentimes, they receive no proper training or protective\n          equipment. They are exposed to many possibilities of explosions and\n          accidents due to the excruciating heat and unregulated safety. In\n          Shashank Bengali’s article “Adult and underage workers risk their\n          lives in Bangladesh&#39;s rising ship-breaking industry,” he mentions\n          17 year old worker Mohammed Shujan Islam, who describes his labor as a\n          “very hard job” and only earning “$3 a day” but only doing it help\n          feed his family (Bengali 1). Another incident accounted by Jowel, a 14\n          year old cutter helper, says “Regularly, I can’t eat anything because\n          I have swallowed too much fume. When you have gas inside your body,\n          you can’t eat. My eyes are crying. When I come back to my room, often\n          I can’t eat because of the strong pain.” These examples exemplify how\n          these exploited children work 12-16 hours a day in life threatening\n          conditions only to make little money.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Many children have to resort to working in harmful conditions like the\n          shipbreaking industry to provide for their families. Child labor is\n          still so prevalent in Bangladesh, especially within poor communities\n          because children need to help their families that recently lost their\n          houses in river erosion or if they lost the main provider of the\n          family. Many laws were passed in 2010 to prohibit underage workers but\n          they weren’t strictly implemented. Inefficient training and unsafe\n          environments contributed to many accidents and even deaths within the\n          industry.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"wStyle\">\n          Sources used:\n          https://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-bangladesh-ships-20160309-story.html\n          https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/DossierPresse-UK-02.pdf\n          https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/Is-There-Child-Labor-in-Shipbreaking-Yards-2014-08-05\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport { content };\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
