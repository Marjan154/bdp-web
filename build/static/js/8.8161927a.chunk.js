Education in itself is a luxury item. That many people fail to be able to afford. Bangladesh has been a predominantly Muslim majority country. Sending students to Madrasas help provide an education to the poorer students even though these religious schools limit the amount of scientific or secular teaching. Religious schools are well respected, and they\u2019re seen as a pure ground of teaching the innocent. Schools with such respected societal views are often more concerned with their own self-image rather than the wellbeing of their students. There are over 4million poor children that seek educational refuge in these religious institutions. 50 Thousand religious schools are currently collectively education these children. 50 thousand religious schools as in 50 thousand institutions that must collectively worry about their reputation so they can continue to hold the amount of societal respect they have held."),l.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"One very recent event that we must shed light on is the injustice done to Nusrat Jahan Rafi by her Madrasa. At only 19 years of age, she was courageous enough to speak out against a sexual predator in her Madrasa and she was forced to pay for this with her life. She had originally filed a sexual harassment complaint. Most sexual harassment complaints like these are easily dismissed. Experiences of sexual abuse from people of such high social status (the headmaster of her Madrasa) are often not reported or easily dismissed. Nusrat on the other hand didn\u2019t stop until action was taken against her claims. Her Madrasa later threatened and bribed her to take down her claims yet she continue to refuse. Later on she was escorted to the roof top by a female student (who had been bribed to do so) and was set on fire by four others. The Police Bureau of investigations, chief Majumder stated that they wanted to frame the murder to make it look like. Suicide. She was son hospitalized for her burns as it covered 80% of her body. While in the ambulance Nusrat stated \u201cThe teacher touched me , I will fight this crime till my last breath\u201d. Later on April 10, 2019 she passed away and several thousands of people gathered to mourn her death and swear to be ring justice out of her wrongful death."),l.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"This is just one particular case that received the recognition and after effect that was well deserved. Many unacknowledged and unreported cases like Nusrat\u2019s are being concealed by those who hold enough social power to do so. Though religious schools are able to provide an education to many students, we also need to take into account the other hardships these educational refuge centers may bring for the children that are the future of Bangladesh.
