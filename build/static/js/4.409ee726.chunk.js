Multiple factors have held Bangladesh back from making advancements to become a well-developed nation. There is a huge gap between the lower and upper class citizens that is resulting in social instability and hostility throughout the nation. There\u2019s a rise in gender inequality against women, especially young girls who are subject to early child marriage. Although many Bangladeshi nongovernmental organizations, like BRAC, made countless efforts towards educating girls and giving women a stronger voice both in the household and public sphere, nothing has changed much for the lives of young girls below age 18 among poor families."),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"Women have always played a significant role in a community\u2019s development, but it is unfortunate how our society fails to value girls who sacrifice their own lives to contribute so much for our community. Although child marriage is seen as a violent crime against human rights throughout a majority part of the world, this practice is still prevalent among many poor families throughout Bangladesh. But, the question is: Does child marriage actually bring any solution to the society\u2019s development or has it become a major barrier that is stopping our country from achieving its potential? According to the UNICEF, Bangladesh has the fourth highest rate of cases involving early child marriage in the world; 74% Bangladeshi girls are forced to marriage before age 18 and 26% before age 14. In many poor families, such young girls are married off due to many factors, including poverty, financial crisis, community tradition, and social insecurity. However, instead of bringing an end to social instability, gender inequality has victimized young girls throughout Bangladesh under domestic violence because they are neither physically nor mentally prepared to become wives and mothers. It is painful how many parents still believe child marriage as a safe decision to secure their daughter\u2019s life, but they do not realize the harmful consequences these young girls have to face at every point of their lifetimes. Later, there is a higher risk for the girls\u2019 lives, especially when they go through the stages of pregnancy and childbirth because they tend to suffer more from health complications due to their early age. It is unfortunate when a 13-year-old girl says: \u2018\u2019my life is destroyed\u2019\u2019, after she is beaten by her husband and is physically abused. At age 13, a girl named Azima was forced to get married because she looked old for her tall height and therefore the community shamed her and her family for not getting married till then; eventually her parents stopped her education. Although she protested a lot for her own life, they did not accept her decision because they were aware of their honor in their community. Immediately after she was married off to a 17-year-old boy, her in-laws and spouse demanded her to have children- only at age 14! Many girls, like Azima, had to go against their own rights and make their surrounding people happy, but it is unfortunate how nobody pays them back for their sacrifices by giving these girls another chance to grow up into well-educated or self-established women in society."),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"That is why it is highly important for Bangladeshi communities to stand up strictly for these young girls\u2019 security. Social and economic pressures cannot stop young girls from achieving their goals or fulfilling their dreams; they must be allowed to move ahead with their education and studies to brighten the future of Bangladesh and to develop their country. Young girls cannot sacrifice their own lives only to protect family honor because they are needed to build the country stronger in the future. While women living in big cities, like Dhaka, are getting great privileges towards higher education and professional careers, young girls who come from poor families in poor villages are neglected from such opportunities that can change their lives for the better one day. Regardless of Bangladesh\u2019s success in accomplishing some developmental goals, the rate of early child marriage still remains high, and this has to come to a stop as soon as possible. Similar to BRAC, many more youth groups have to become socially active throughout Bangladesh in order to stop such unfairness or violence against young girls/women in society. Those poor families who tend to force their children into marriage to save their daughters from sexual harassment or stigma have to realize that marriage is not an effective solution because many of those young girls (12-18) suffer from domestic violence when their husbands beat them up. No girl deserves such unfair humiliation where they have no more hopes in their lives. Every girl should be given her own rights to make her own decisions about her body, education, career, or any other personal components. Certain social systems in Bangladesh cannot stop any young girl/woman from building the future she wants because they are the bright, colorful stars of the country\u2019s future who will help and contribute to make Bangladesh a well-developed nation one day."),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"wStyle"},"Works Cited",h.a.createElement("br",null),"https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/human-rights/news/all-women-and-girls-must-be-able-build-the-future-they-want-1714600",h.a.createElement("br",null),"https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/06/09/marry-your-house-swept-away/child-marriage-bangladesh https://www.slideshare.net/limonmh1/child-marriage-in-bangladesh",h.a.createElement("br",null)))}}]),t}(l.Component))}}]);
