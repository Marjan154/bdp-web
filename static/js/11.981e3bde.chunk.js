Multiple claims have been made by families of their deceased family members. For example, a first year student in the Zoology department from Dhaka University, named Afia Akter Chaity, had died in the hospital due to an error in identifying the main cause of her sickness. In 2018, she was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid (Myeloblastic) Leukemia, which is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow, acute meaning it occurs rapidly. However, despite the analysis proving the same diagnostic, doctors said she was suffering from Dengue, a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. An article in the Dhaka Tribune stated, \u201c...Sometimes the doctors refused to share information about the patient with their family members, which can lead to wrong treatment.\u201d Doctors don't always tell the truth to the patient's family so they can prescribe the wrong medicine on purpose.

Another similar case occurred in 2011 with an eight month old baby, the baby remains nameless. His dad, Mustafiz (not his real name), took the baby to the United Hospital and later he was placed in an intensive care unit. Mustafiz was told that his child was suffering from pneumonia, so they shifted his kid to a normal room; he was put under the ventilator for eighteen days. After twenty-one days, his baby died and the doctors didn't release any information about the cause of the death. After this incident, Dhaka Tribune said, Mustafiz created a group on Facebook called \u201cBlacklist Doctors.\u201d Multiple people wrote a countless numbers of doctors names who used wrong treatments or their practice resulted in the patients' deaths."),l.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"These deaths have made people question whether or not they should go to the hospital. Usually when people go to treat their illness, they get a wrong treatment in Bangladesh and when they travel to a hospital in another country, they are told that they didn't need to do a certain action. For example, in the Dhaka Tribune, Afrose Jahan Chaity said, \u201cIn fiscal year 2015-16, India saw 460,000 inbound patients at its different hospitals,...165,000 were from Bangladesh. Interestingly, only around 58,000 medical visas were issued to Bangladeshi nationals then, the survey reveals\u201d (Chaity). Usually patients would be confused on what to do and have no trust in Bangladeshi doctors so they relied heavily on hospitals in other countries. Another example is from 2001, Suraiaya Begum, found a tumour present in her back. When she went to a hospital in Dhaka, they removed her left ovary. However, when she went to Kolkata, a doctor had informed her that removing her ovary was unnecessary and she could've have better treatment.
