In fact, Daulatdia, which is 100km west of the capital of Bangladesh, is known to be a brothel-district and has been called one of the biggest brothels in the world. It is an entire village that is centered around prostitution. The second largest brothel in Bangladesh is the Tangail District Brothel. The sex workers in these brothels are, more often than not, very young girls from the age of 10 and they all have one thing in common: extremely poor social and financial conditions."),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"Despite the fact that Bangladesh is a secular nation, it is also a predominantly Islamic country and these brothels operate on thin ice amongst the Muslim society. Bangladesh is one of few Muslim countries where prostitution is legal. What does this entail? The workers and the buyers are vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDs and STDs, the literacy rate stays in equilibrium or in some cases decline, early pregnancy may occur, and lastly self-esteem and self-confidence may deplete. Some of the sex workers may even be given steroids or other drugs to make them seem much more full-figured and volumptuous, so they can appeal to the male gaze. Young girls get sold off are trafficked to men who are double or more than triple their age. For a child to be stripped away of their childhood and thrown into a brothel is worrisome. Someone who could ideally be a father and take away these children\u2019s innocence is beyond a call for help and is a sign of a state of emergency."),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"Most of the women in the Daulatdia and Tangail districts cannot afford food or other necessities for themselves and their children, so they resort to sending their young sons to work and exploit themselves as well as their daughters to those who are willing to pay for sex. This can only provide them the basic necessities, but cannot afford the cost of school, therefore a lot of sex workers are illiterate. Over 1,000 enslaved, young, or abandoned women traffic themselves in the Daulatdia district. We owe the children and women of Bangladesh so much more than investing in a field of work that harms their physical and mental well-being."),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"Hope is in high demand but in short supply with many of the young sex workers in these slums. The prevalence of brothels in Bangladesh is unfortunately much too lucrative for thousands in the area and it should not have to be this way. No one needs to empathize to logically see that there must be reform. With education, reform and with out-pouring support, many of the girls may find themselves out of this situation."),h.a.createElement("div",{className:"wStyle"},"Works Cited",h.a.createElement("br",null),"\u201cUN Team Visit Tangail Brothel as a Part of the 16 Days of Activism Campaign against Gender-Based Violence.\u201d UNFPA Bangladesh | UN Team Visit Tangail Brothel as a Part of the 16 Days of Activism Campaign against Gender-Based Violence, United Nations Population Fund, 24 Dec. 2018, bangladesh.unfpa.org/en/news/un-team-visit-tangail-brothel-part-16-days-activism-campaign-against-gender-based-violence.",h.a.createElement("br",null),"Buncombe, Andrew. \u201cIndependent Appeal: Sex Workers Dicing with Death in Bangladesh.\u201d The Independent, Independent Digital News and Media, 23 Oct. 2011, www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/independent-appeal-sex-workers-dicing-with-death-in-bangladesh-1216245.html.",h.a.createElement("br",null),"Joan M.
