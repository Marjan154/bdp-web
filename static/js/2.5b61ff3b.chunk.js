Every article of clothing that has gotten its way into our hands has its own story, but chances are it was most likely made by impoverished people in developing countries, such as Bangladesh. Many of these workers, in fact, are actually children as young as ten who work long hours in poor working conditions for low wages. Unfortunately, child labor is a particularly common practice within Bangladesh\u2019s expansive textile and garments manufacturing industry \u2013 which has steadily gained international recognition as one of the largest garments exporters and distributors in the world.\u201d 1"),c.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"As Bangladesh struggles with a growing demand for more jobs due to overpopulation \u2013 which is only projected to increase to nearly 185 million by 2030, its garments industry has served a valuable role in employing more than 25 million people, most of whom are women and young children from poor families.2 Nevertheless, this financial stability does not justify the exploitation of children in garment factories. According to a 2016 study conducted by the Overseas Development Institute, \u201cchildren as young as six employed full time and others working up to 100 to 110 hours a week \u2026 [earned] on average less than $2 a day.\u201d3"),c.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"But what leads children in Bangladesh to work in garments factories? The answer lies within a larger issue \u2013 poverty. Due to the \u201cabsence of living wages, adequate social protection schemes, lack of opportunities to access education and prevailing social norms\u201d many children are pressured to work in these factories at a young age \u2013 especially those whose parents are already garments factory workers. Working in garment factories is one of the few ways poor children in Bangladesh can contribute to supporting themselves and their families which, in turn, negatively impacts their quality of education and prevents them from continuing school.
