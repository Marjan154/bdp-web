To become a prostitute, a woman\n          must submit an affidavit stating they want to be a prostitute under\n          their own choice and that they cannot find any other work. Given this\n          offer, a struggling woman may decide to submit an affidavit and sell\n          her body for sex in exchange for money. The reasons for working such a\n          gruesome job include seeking refuge, need for survival, poor living\n          conditions, issues with family, and/or being forced or sold off to a\n          brothel at a young age. Often times, the issues associated with\n          becoming a prostitute can have devastating effects on a womanâ€™s mental\n          health. A prostitute is prone to be condemned, disgraced, degraded,\n          mistreated, abused, and neglected by her social environment. Despite\n          these circumstances, struggling women in Bangladesh have no choice but\n          to continue working in order to make money and survive.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Moyna, a woman raised in a small rural town to the west of Dhaka,\n          recalls her traumatic experience growing up as a child and becoming a\n          prostitute. She was sold to a brothel house by her husband at a very\n          young age, however the process and events that preceded this were\n          arguably even more life-altering. When she was 11, she had lived a\n          carefree childhood, going to school regularly and playing outside. She\n          would frequently play hide-and-seek with her 15-year old cousin,\n          Monir. One day, she decided to forego playing for a day and go home.\n          Upon reaching home, her grandmother told her that she will marry Monir\n          by next week, explaining that everything had been arranged for her to\n          settle into a marriage. As a young girl, Moyna had no idea what\n          marriage entailed. As a 11-year old girl she knew little about life\n          other than going to school and playing with her friends. Furthermore,\n          the legal age of marriage in Bangladesh is 18. Despite this law,\n          certain loopholes allow for underage marriages. Also, the law is\n          frequently disobeyed, which led to Bangladesh having the highest rate\n          of marriage in the world for girls under the age of 15. With little\n          choice, Moyna continued into the marriage, and soon after had a baby\n          at the age of 12. After some time, Monir invited her to a small\n          village called Daulatdia so that they could spend time together. Once\n          arriving, Monir took her to a small room and told her he would step\n          out for a bit, and never returned. Soon, she realized what had\n          happened to her. She was sold to a brothel house for a price of\n          300,000 taka (approx.. 3.5k USD.) As years passed, she became\n          dedicated to this lifestyle, being dependent on the income she would\n          get from selling sex to approximately 15-20 customers daily. In the\n          brothel house, she had witnessed several young children experiencing\n          the same dreadful circumstances as her. Many kids had foregone their\n          income for their services in exchange for food.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Several stories similar to the one stated exist in Bangladesh. Despite\n          the widespread occurrence of illegal forms of prostitution, the legal\n          forms of prostitution are common as well. For example, a woman who\n          gets a divorce with her long time husband can face difficulties\n          raising enough income to support herself and her children. Often times\n          the woman is a stay-at-home mom who takes care of the children and\n          maintains the household while the husband works to earn a living\n          income. Women who have economic dependence on their husband are at\n          risk of having difficult living standards after a divorce.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Another circumstance that can cause a woman to pursue a career in\n          prostitution is not having a stable living condition. An example is a\n          woman who is homeless, poor, hungry, and uneducated. Giving these\n          unfavorable qualities, the labor force can deny her basic jobs. Also,\n          she may not have a partner to support her. This can motivate her to\n          pursue a career in prostitution in order to continue living her life.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Prostitution can allow for woman to earn an income to support their\n          lives, however the associated issues evidently trump any benefit\n          gained from the work. One can very easily see the work as demoralizing\n          and degrading. Despite this, brothel homes in Bangladesh continue to\n          exist and grow in its population, and poverty and social issues play a\n          large role in the growth of prostitution\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"wStyle\">\n          Works Cited\n          <br />\n          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Bangladesh#Child_prostitution\n          <br />\n          https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/longform/a40923/bangladesh-husband-sold-me-to-a-brothel/\n          <br />\n          https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2017/07/bangladesh-biggest-brothel-170726081750179.html\n          <br />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport { content };\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
