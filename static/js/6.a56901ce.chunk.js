However on average about 1.5 million girls drop out of school or never attend. The quality of education makes a massive difference in attaining one as well. Bangladesh sees more dropout rates in the secondary years because of the poor quality of schools. This causes poor attendance and participation, and lower standards of achievement. Despite these ratings, there has been an increase and implementation of madrasas that have enabled an urgent response in girls education. With the idea of religious beliefs being catered to, parents feel that they are achieving not only civil/general education, but also fulfilling religious obligations as well. Because of this there has been an increase in enrollments at madrasas than traditional schooling."),l.a.createElement("div",{className:"pStyle"},"Growing up, I have been aware of the disparity of women in school versus women in the household.
