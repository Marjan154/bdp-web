However, there are those who never even\n          known of an alternative life. These girls are those who were born into\n          prostitution. Despite there existing laws that forbid child\n          prostitution, they are not upheld and as a result brothels consist of\n          large group of minors. Girls who are unfortunate enough to be born\n          into prostitution have had their lives decided for them at conception.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          The young girls who were born into prostitution had no opportunity to\n          get an education to prepare for a better life. They have no family to\n          escape to as they are usually birthed from a prostitute and a\n          customer. The government enables the victimization while society shuns\n          the victims. With no money, nowhere to go, and no support from society\n          or a higher institution, they are essentially imprisoned to a life of\n          emotional, sexual, and physical abuse. They are forever branded as\n          “bonded girls”.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Unfortunately, the struggle of “bonded girls” does not just end here.\n          Many of them are forced to take body enhancing drugs, the same\n          steroids used to fatten cattle. These drugs make young girls gain\n          weight and curves, despite being severely malnourished and unhealthy.\n          The consequences of these drugs are debilitating, but they are ignored\n          in exchange for better business.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          In addition to this, the young girls themselves barely make one dollar\n          a day. Those who bear their own children must provide for themselves\n          and their children with this income. If somehow they are able to send\n          their children off to somewhere better, the money they make is rarely\n          enough to provide. If they cannot, their children then have to live as\n          a prostitute, and the cycle begins again. To make things worse, the\n          blood stained money is often even confiscated from the workers.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          While these girls are put in an impossible situation, they are by no\n          means weak. When they grow up, many working prostitutes try to protect\n          their children from such a horrible life, and go through extensive\n          measures to give them access to education and isolate them from the\n          brothels. With their collective effort, they will bring the change and\n          freedom that society failed to give them.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          “Eleven-year-old Shefali, a prostitute, gets her eyebrow threaded.\n          Shefali was born in Kandapara brothel because her mother was also a\n          prostitute. She has to serve around 20-25 customers per day. Shefali\n          doesn&#39;t know how much she earns as her Madam takes away all of her\n          income. In exchange she gets food three times a day and, occasionally,\n          some gifts.”\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"wStyle\">\n          Works Cited\n          <br />\n          https://widerimage.reuters.com/story/teenage-prostitutes-in-bangladesh\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport { content };\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
