Usually they are constrained to\n          gender roles that they’ve been determined to since birth. In\n          particular, the country of Bangladesh sees a significant disparity in\n          gender roles in terms of household work and labor force. The identity\n          of women lies in the traditional standard of being a housewife and\n          mother and they are not expected to provide economically. The idea of\n          a woman breaking out this tradition is still widely debated in this\n          day and age.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          UNICEF reports that there has been a rise in enrollment for girls\n          within primary and lower secondary schools in the 90’s. However on\n          average about 1.5 million girls drop out of school or never attend.\n          The quality of education makes a massive difference in attaining one\n          as well. Bangladesh sees more dropout rates in the secondary years\n          because of the poor quality of schools. This causes poor attendance\n          and participation, and lower standards of achievement. Despite these\n          ratings, there has been an increase and implementation of madrasas\n          that have enabled an urgent response in girls education. With the idea\n          of religious beliefs being catered to, parents feel that they are\n          achieving not only civil/general education, but also fulfilling\n          religious obligations as well. Because of this there has been an\n          increase in enrollments at madrasas than traditional schooling.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Growing up, I have been aware of the disparity of women in school\n          versus women in the household. My mother who was able to secure a\n          masters degree in Bangladesh always made a point to take advantage of\n          my education that was granted to me because there are so many girls\n          who are put into positions where they must sacrifice their livelihoods\n          in order to have an education. My mother was fortunate enough to be in\n          a household where education was a priority and was taught about the\n          power that comes with seeking knowledge. Due to the emphasis of\n          education throughout my life I have sought out to be in the education\n          field and provide knowledge to those who truly want it.\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Even though there has been progression with enrollment rates, due to\n          the rapid urbanization, safety and reliable source of transportation\n          have been compromised. Women are subjected to sexual harassment and\n          experience violence on their commute. It’s difficult to make progress\n          in a country where patriarchal norms dominate so much where “one third\n          of women aged 15-49 believe in at least one justification for a\n          husband hitting his wife, such as arguing with him.” Even though there\n          has been progress for women in Bangladesh, there is still much more to\n          accomplish. We are only scratching the surface of the glass ceiling.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"wStyle\">\n          Asian Development Bank. “Bangladesh Women Making Progress But Still\n          Face Gender Gap.” Asian Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, 7\n          Feb. 2018,\n          www.adb.org/news/bangladesh-women-making-progress-still-face-gender-gap.\n          Project, Borgen. “Girls' Education in Bangladesh.” The Borgen Project,\n          Borgen Project\n          Https://Borgenproject.org/Wp-Content/Uploads/The_Borgen_Project_Logo_small.Jpg,\n          9 Apr. 2019, borgenproject.org/girls-education-in-bangladesh/.\n          https://youtu.be/6tGUcduE4gY\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport { content };\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
