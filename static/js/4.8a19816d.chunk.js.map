Multiple factors have held Bangladesh back\n          from making advancements to become a well-developed nation. There is a\n          huge gap between the lower and upper class citizens that is resulting\n          in social instability and hostility throughout the nation. There’s a\n          rise in gender inequality against women, especially young girls who\n          are subject to early child marriage. Although many Bangladeshi\n          nongovernmental organizations, like BRAC, made countless efforts\n          towards educating girls and giving women a stronger voice both in the\n          household and public sphere, nothing has changed much for the lives of\n          young girls below age 18 among poor families.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Women have always played a significant role in a community’s\n          development, but it is unfortunate how our society fails to value\n          girls who sacrifice their own lives to contribute so much for our\n          community. Although child marriage is seen as a violent crime against\n          human rights throughout a majority part of the world, this practice is\n          still prevalent among many poor families throughout Bangladesh. But,\n          the question is: Does child marriage actually bring any solution to\n          the society’s development or has it become a major barrier that is\n          stopping our country from achieving its potential? According to the\n          UNICEF, Bangladesh has the fourth highest rate of cases involving\n          early child marriage in the world; 74% Bangladeshi girls are forced to\n          marriage before age 18 and 26% before age 14. In many poor families,\n          such young girls are married off due to many factors, including\n          poverty, financial crisis, community tradition, and social insecurity.\n          However, instead of bringing an end to social instability, gender\n          inequality has victimized young girls throughout Bangladesh under\n          domestic violence because they are neither physically nor mentally\n          prepared to become wives and mothers. It is painful how many parents\n          still believe child marriage as a safe decision to secure their\n          daughter’s life, but they do not realize the harmful consequences\n          these young girls have to face at every point of their lifetimes.\n          Later, there is a higher risk for the girls’ lives, especially when\n          they go through the stages of pregnancy and childbirth because they\n          tend to suffer more from health complications due to their early age.\n          It is unfortunate when a 13-year-old girl says: ‘’my life is\n          destroyed’’, after she is beaten by her husband and is physically\n          abused. At age 13, a girl named Azima was forced to get married\n          because she looked old for her tall height and therefore the community\n          shamed her and her family for not getting married till then;\n          eventually her parents stopped her education. Although she protested a\n          lot for her own life, they did not accept her decision because they\n          were aware of their honor in their community. Immediately after she\n          was married off to a 17-year-old boy, her in-laws and spouse demanded\n          her to have children- only at age 14! Many girls, like Azima, had to\n          go against their own rights and make their surrounding people happy,\n          but it is unfortunate how nobody pays them back for their sacrifices\n          by giving these girls another chance to grow up into well-educated or\n          self-established women in society.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          That is why it is highly important for Bangladeshi communities to\n          stand up strictly for these young girls’ security. Social and economic\n          pressures cannot stop young girls from achieving their goals or\n          fulfilling their dreams; they must be allowed to move ahead with their\n          education and studies to brighten the future of Bangladesh and to\n          develop their country. Young girls cannot sacrifice their own lives\n          only to protect family honor because they are needed to build the\n          country stronger in the future. While women living in big cities, like\n          Dhaka, are getting great privileges towards higher education and\n          professional careers, young girls who come from poor families in poor\n          villages are neglected from such opportunities that can change their\n          lives for the better one day. Regardless of Bangladesh’s success in\n          accomplishing some developmental goals, the rate of early child\n          marriage still remains high, and this has to come to a stop as soon as\n          possible. Similar to BRAC, many more youth groups have to become\n          socially active throughout Bangladesh in order to stop such unfairness\n          or violence against young girls/women in society. Those poor families\n          who tend to force their children into marriage to save their daughters\n          from sexual harassment or stigma have to realize that marriage is not\n          an effective solution because many of those young girls (12-18) suffer\n          from domestic violence when their husbands beat them up. No girl\n          deserves such unfair humiliation where they have no more hopes in\n          their lives. Every girl should be given her own rights to make her own\n          decisions about her body, education, career, or any other personal\n          components. Certain social systems in Bangladesh cannot stop any young\n          girl/woman from building the future she wants because they are the\n          bright, colorful stars of the country’s future who will help and\n          contribute to make Bangladesh a well-developed nation one day.\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"wStyle\">\n          Works Cited\n          <br />\n          https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/human-rights/news/all-women-and-girls-must-be-able-build-the-future-they-want-1714600\n          <br />\n          https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/06/09/marry-your-house-swept-away/child-marriage-bangladesh\n          https://www.slideshare.net/limonmh1/child-marriage-in-bangladesh\n          <br />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport { content };\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
