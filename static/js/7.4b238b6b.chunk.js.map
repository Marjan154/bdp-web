The net\n          enrollment rate at primary school level is said to have increased from\n          80 percent in 2000 to 98 percent in 2015, and secondary school net\n          enrollment is now around 54 percent, up from 45 percent in 2000. On\n          the other hand, the percentage of children completing primary school\n          is close to 80 percent.However, approximately five million Bangladeshi\n          children between the ages of six and 13 specifically from poor\n          families, urban slums, and rural areas choose to work and provide for\n          the family instead of getting an education given the crude poverty\n          that they experience. Even though gender parity is also achieved in\n          terms of education access, disparity still remains, especially in hard\n          to reach rural areas where specifically females are heavily\n          discouraged from receiving any form of education.Cultural beliefs of\n          viewing women as inferiors or being limited only to household arena\n          result in many young girls confined within the houses before or after\n          their marriages or receiving only partial religious education in\n          institutions called Madrasha. Many students also drop out of schools\n          or colleges in order to handle the financial responsibility of the\n          family. As a result, Bangladesh’s workforce of 87 million is reported\n          to be largely undereducated with only 4 percent of workers having\n          higher than secondary education.\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pStyle\">\n          Although the government, along with many nonprofit organizations,\n          particularly one named BRAC, is working to ensure that no child is\n          left behind from the lights of education, the dream of universal\n          education is still far from being accomplished. In order to ensure\n          widespread access to public education, more schools are needed to be\n          built, along with the recruitment of more teachers who can plant the\n          seed of knowledge among the young and those who are left to dire\n          poverty. As per data, spending on education accounts for 14.4% of the\n          national budget, which corresponds to 2% of GDP. Given that many are\n          still without education it is necessary that more be spent on the\n          education sector.\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"wStyle\">\n          Sources used:\n          <br />\n          “Bangladesh: Ensuring Education for All Bangladeshis.” World Bank,\n          projects-beta.worldbank.org/en/results/2016/10/07/ensuring-education-for-all-bangladeshis.\n          <br />\n          “Education in Bangladesh.” Education in Bangladesh | Global\n          Partnership for Education,\n          www.globalpartnership.org/country/bangladesh.\n          <br />\n          \"Health Policy in Bangladesh.\" Wikipedia.
