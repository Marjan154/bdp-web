          In patriarchal societies, women are unable to further their ambitions
          and have control of their agency. Usually they are constrained to
          gender roles that they’ve been determined to since birth. In
          particular, the country of Bangladesh sees a significant disparity in
          gender roles in terms of household work and labor force. The identity
          of women lies in the traditional standard of being a housewife and
          mother and they are not expected to provide economically. The idea of
          a woman breaking out this tradition is still widely debated in this
          day and age.

          UNICEF reports that there has been a rise in enrollment for girls
          within primary and lower secondary schools in the 90’s. However on
          average about 1.5 million girls drop out of school or never attend.
          The quality of education makes a massive difference in attaining one
          as well. Bangladesh sees more dropout rates in the secondary years
          because of the poor quality of schools. This causes poor attendance
          and participation, and lower standards of achievement. Despite these
          ratings, there has been an increase and implementation of madrasas
          that have enabled an urgent response in girls education. With the idea
          of religious beliefs being catered to, parents feel that they are
          achieving not only civil/general education, but also fulfilling
          religious obligations as well. Because of this there has been an
          increase in enrollments at madrasas than traditional schooling.

          Growing up, I have been aware of the disparity of women in school
          versus women in the household. My mother who was able to secure a
          masters degree in Bangladesh always made a point to take advantage of
          my education that was granted to me because there are so many girls
          who are put into positions where they must sacrifice their livelihoods
          in order to have an education. My mother was fortunate enough to be in
          a household where education was a priority and was taught about the
          power that comes with seeking knowledge. Due to the emphasis of
          education throughout my life I have sought out to be in the education
          field and provide knowledge to those who truly want it.

          Even though there has been progression with enrollment rates, due to
          the rapid urbanization, safety and reliable source of transportation
          have been compromised. Women are subjected to sexual harassment and
          experience violence on their commute. It’s difficult to make progress
          in a country where patriarchal norms dominate so much where “one third
          of women aged 15-49 believe in at least one justification for a
          husband hitting his wife, such as arguing with him.” Even though there
          has been progress for women in Bangladesh, there is still much more to
          accomplish. We are only scratching the surface of the glass ceiling.
