    Child Labor in Shipbreaking Industries The shipbreaking industry has one of
    the most hazardous working conditions in Bangladesh. This industry attracts
    many young and poor laborers who have no previous work experience, are
    underage, and live in poverty. Many factors influenced underage children to
    find work in Chittagong, the shipbreaking industry’s hub. Some includes the
    child’s father passing away or losing their job and/or their house being
    lost because of river erosion. These tragic circumstances give these
    children no choice but to work in these dangerous conditions and provide for
    their families. Shumon, an underage worker, describes his harsh reality and
    many other children in “me and my brother still struggle to meet the needs
    of the family. We cannot save a single penny from our income. I dream of
    leading a happy life in the village. I want to go back to my home. I miss my
    village a lot” (Laursen 1). Although new laws and regulations were passed in
    2010 to ensure that no one under the age of 18 worked in these risky
    environments, the laws weren’t strictly implemented and underage children
    were still able to work freely. Even after the law banning underage
    laborers, it’s still estimated that 20-25% of shipbreaking workers are
    children. To ensure that underage laborers aren’t detected, they are often
    hired informally and are assigned to work at night. Hazardous conditions
    lead to many injuries and even deaths within the industry. Most children are
    assigned to removing scrap parts from the mud, shaving down steel plates,
    remove fittings from inside ships, climb into tanks to clean them out, carry
    around heavy gas cylinders, moving parts of the ship like chains and cables,
    or relocating other heavy pieces of ship to trucks. These are children under
    18, sometimes even 8 or 9 years old, handling sharp and dangerous objects to
    provide for their families. These children are subject to even more injuries
    because oftentimes, they receive no proper training or protective equipment.
    They are exposed to many possibilities of explosions and accidents due to
    the excruciating heat and unregulated safety. In Shashank Bengali’s article
    “Adult and underage workers risk their lives in Bangladesh's rising
    ship-breaking industry,” he mentions 17 year old worker Mohammed Shujan
    Islam, who describes his labor as a “very hard job” and only earning “$3 a
    day” but only doing it help feed his family (Bengali 1). Another incident
    accounted by Jowel, a 14 year old cutter helper, says “Regularly, I can’t
    eat anything because I have swallowed too much fume. When you have gas
    inside your body, you can’t eat. My eyes are crying. When I come back to my
    room, often I can’t eat because of the strong pain.” These examples
    exemplify how these exploited children work 12-16 hours a day in life
    threatening conditions only to make little money. Many children have to
    resort to working in harmful conditions like the shipbreaking industry to
    provide for their families. Child labor is still so prevalent in Bangladesh,
    especially within poor communities because children need to help their
    families that recently lost their houses in river erosion or if they lost
    the main provider of the family. Many laws were passed in 2010 to prohibit
    underage workers but they weren’t strictly implemented. Inefficient training
    and unsafe environments contributed to many accidents and even deaths within
    the industry. Sources used:
