    Pedophilia Related to Child Brides By: Mahima Hayat Child brides are the
    gateway for grown men to have access to pedophilic acts. This cultural
    practice is just an unjust and undercover way for men to receive sex, much
    like with prostitutes in these slum areas, the brides can be young, but are
    also sometimes much younger. Why would men be interested in such an act?
    Simply put, they are pedophiles. In Bangladesh, early marriage and child
    brides were always largely practiced despite it being illegal, however on
    March 1st, 2017 the Bangladeshi Parliament passed a law which basically
    allowed child marriage under special circumstances under The Child Marriage
    Restraint Act of 2017. This makes suitors and buyers psychologically think
    that they are not doing anything wrong. According to Unicef, Bangladesh has
    the fourth highest child marriage rates in the world. Child brides are
    sexually abused almost daily for the pleasure of full grown men whom are
    twice or triple times the bride’s size and the bride’s age. Reasons why this
    may be a cultural practice other than the fact that the suitors or buyers
    being allowed to pay money to commit pedophilic acts, it is because these
    families come from very low class and penury backgrounds which limits the
    possibilities for them as well as their offspring. School and access to
    education is not an option so young boys are sent or sold off to work, and
    young girls are sold off as prostitutes or are married off to grown men. The
    bride’s families usually receive bride price for their daughters. Bride
    price is what the bride is worth in terms of money and other items such as
    jewelry. Causes of child brides and early marriages include domestic
    violence, sexual abuse, pedophilia, low literacy rates, poverty, dowry,
    cultural pressures, and the hinderance of getting to actually work or have a
    career. These are also the causes of a lack of education/access to
    education. Domestic violence and rape can stem from these situations that
    leave the girls in a very vulnerable place. These men who marry young girls
    are given a chance to fulfil their fantasies and without remorse they
    forcefully adjust themselves into the bride’s life and sexual abuse stems
    from this. In the following image, the girl seems to look unenthusiastic
    right before the wedding ceremony in which she is being married off to a man
    much older than her... These events lead up to long-lasting trauma starting
    from an early age where these girls’ childhoods are stripped away from them.
    Statistics show that over 60% of girls from rural and slum areas are being
    married off as child brides. In 2005, the percentage girls under the age of
    15 being married off was around 30% and in 2015 the percentage of girls
    under the age of 18 being married off was almost 70%. Currently in 2019, the
    rates remain at an equilibrium since 2015 with the rates fluctuating but it
    is our mission to significantly reduce that. In order for everything to be
    changed for the better, the act of child brides and early marriages must be
    banned. Pedophilia in early marriages must be shamed and against the law.
    Girls need resources, education, access to healthcare and support from their
    families and well as their communities to fully prosper in life and provide
    for their families. We must give them access to education and other
    necessities so that they may have a list of possibilities. References Human
