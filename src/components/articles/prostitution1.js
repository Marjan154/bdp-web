    It is not uncommon that women are sold, forced or tricked into prostitution
    in Bangladesh. However, there are those who never even known of an
    alternative life. These girls are those who were born into prostitution.
    Despite there existing laws that forbid child prostitution, they are not
    upheld and as a result brothels consist of large group of minors. Girls who
    are unfortunate enough to be born into prostitution have had their lives
    decided for them at conception. The young girls who were born into
    prostitution had no opportunity to get an education to prepare for a better
    life. They have no family to escape to as they are usually birthed from a
    prostitute and a customer. The government enables the victimization while
    society shuns the victims. With no money, nowhere to go, and no support from
    society or a higher institution, they are essentially imprisoned to a life
    of emotional, sexual, and physical abuse. They are forever branded as
    “bonded girls”. Unfortunately, the struggle of “bonded girls” does not just
    end here. Many of them are forced to take body enhancing drugs, the same
    steroids used to fatten cattle. These drugs make young girls gain weight and
    curves, despite being severely malnourished and unhealthy. The consequences
    of these drugs are debilitating, but they are ignored in exchange for better
    business. In addition to this, the young girls themselves barely make one
    dollar a day. Those who bear their own children must provide for themselves
    and their children with this income. If somehow they are able to send their
    children off to somewhere better, the money they make is rarely enough to
    provide. If they cannot, their children will then have to live as a
    prostitute, and the cycle begins again. To make things worse, the blood
    stained money is often even confiscated from the workers. While these girls
    are put in an impossible situation, they are by no means weak. When they
    grow up, many working prostitutes try to protect their children from such a
    horrible life, and go through extensive measures to give them access to
    education and isolate them from the brothels. With their collective effort,
    they will bring the change and freedom that society failed to give them.
