          In recent years, Bangladesh has undoubtedly shown significant progress
          in children’s health and education, but unfortunately this country is
          still considered to be one of the poorest nations in the world- not
          only in terms of financial/working conditions- but also in terms of
          their living conditions. Multiple factors have held Bangladesh back
          from making advancements to become a well-developed nation. There is a
          huge gap between the lower and upper class citizens that is resulting
          in social instability and hostility throughout the nation. There’s a
          rise in gender inequality against women, especially young girls who
          are subject to early child marriage. Although many Bangladeshi
          nongovernmental organizations, like BRAC, made countless efforts
          towards educating girls and giving women a stronger voice both in the
          household and public sphere, nothing has changed much for the lives of
          young girls below age 18 among poor families.

          Women have always played a significant role in a community’s
          development, but it is unfortunate how our society fails to value
          girls who sacrifice their own lives to contribute so much for our
          community. Although child marriage is seen as a violent crime against
          human rights throughout a majority part of the world, this practice is
          still prevalent among many poor families throughout Bangladesh. But,
          the question is: Does child marriage actually bring any solution to
          the society’s development or has it become a major barrier that is
          stopping our country from achieving its potential? According to the
          UNICEF, Bangladesh has the fourth highest rate of cases involving
          early child marriage in the world; 74% Bangladeshi girls are forced to
          marriage before age 18 and 26% before age 14. In many poor families,
          such young girls are married off due to many factors, including
          poverty, financial crisis, community tradition, and social insecurity.
          However, instead of bringing an end to social instability, gender
          inequality has victimized young girls throughout Bangladesh under
          domestic violence because they are neither physically nor mentally
          prepared to become wives and mothers. It is painful how many parents
          still believe child marriage as a safe decision to secure their
          daughter’s life, but they do not realize the harmful consequences
          these young girls have to face at every point of their lifetimes.
          Later, there is a higher risk for the girls’ lives, especially when
          they go through the stages of pregnancy and childbirth because they
          tend to suffer more from health complications due to their early age.
          It is unfortunate when a 13-year-old girl says: ‘’my life is
          destroyed’’, after she is beaten by her husband and is physically
          abused. At age 13, a girl named Azima was forced to get married
          because she looked old for her tall height and therefore the community
          shamed her and her family for not getting married till then;
          eventually her parents stopped her education. Although she protested a
          lot for her own life, they did not accept her decision because they
          were aware of their honor in their community. Immediately after she
          was married off to a 17-year-old boy, her in-laws and spouse demanded
          her to have children- only at age 14! Many girls, like Azima, had to
          go against their own rights and make their surrounding people happy,
          but it is unfortunate how nobody pays them back for their sacrifices
          by giving these girls another chance to grow up into well-educated or
          self-established women in society.

          That is why it is highly important for Bangladeshi communities to
          stand up strictly for these young girls’ security. Social and economic
          pressures cannot stop young girls from achieving their goals or
          fulfilling their dreams; they must be allowed to move ahead with their
          education and studies to brighten the future of Bangladesh and to
          develop their country. Young girls cannot sacrifice their own lives
          only to protect family honor because they are needed to build the
          country stronger in the future. While women living in big cities, like
          Dhaka, are getting great privileges towards higher education and
          professional careers, young girls who come from poor families in poor
          villages are neglected from such opportunities that can change their
          lives for the better one day. Regardless of Bangladesh’s success in
          accomplishing some developmental goals, the rate of early child
          marriage still remains high, and this has to come to a stop as soon as
          possible. Similar to BRAC, many more youth groups have to become
          socially active throughout Bangladesh in order to stop such unfairness
          or violence against young girls/women in society. Those poor families
          who tend to force their children into marriage to save their daughters
          from sexual harassment or stigma have to realize that marriage is not
          an effective solution because many of those young girls (12-18) suffer
          from domestic violence when their husbands beat them up. No girl
          deserves such unfair humiliation where they have no more hopes in
          their lives. Every girl should be given her own rights to make her own
          decisions about her body, education, career, or any other personal
          components. Certain social systems in Bangladesh cannot stop any young
          girl/woman from building the future she wants because they are the
          bright, colorful stars of the country’s future who will help and
          contribute to make Bangladesh a well-developed nation one day.
