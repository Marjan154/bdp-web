        <h1 className="tStyle">Heavy Metals and Bangladesh Waters</h1>

        <h5>By: Mohammed Tousif Nur</h5>

        <div className="pStyle">
          Bangladesh is a river-studded nation with country coastlines located
          on the South along the Bay of Bengal. The rivers are instrumental in
          providing water to grow crops in Bangladesh. However, these waters can
          be contaminated by heavy metals leaching from man-made industrial
          processes in Bangladesh. Heavy metals are those metals of high
          densities and atomic masses (an atomic mass unit is equivalent to
          one-twelfth the mass of a Carbon-12 atom). As a result, humans and
          animals situated in Bangladesh can accumulate those heavy metals by
          consumption of water and agricultural products containing those heavy
          metals.
        </div>
        <div className="pStyle">
          Trace amounts of heavy metals are needed for physiological and
          physical processes helping humans and animals to maintain homeostasis
          (the state of normalcy and maximum stability in organisms for
          survival). Increased concentrations of heavy metals in living
          organisms beyond trace amounts can lead to negative health effects and
          disruption of homeostasis. This essay covers very briefly the history
          of heavy metal detection in Bangladesh and possible health effects of
          those heavy metals. In their official website, World Health
          Organization (WHO) suggests various limits on concentrations of heavy
          metals in water supplies for safe consumption of water. In Bangladesh,
          measured water Arsenic of concentrations 500 µg/L and 100 µg/L
          exceeded the WHO’s water Arsenic limit of 10 µg/L (Loewenberg, 2016).
          In addition, Karnaphuli River of Bangladesh was found to have
          concentrations of Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, and Lead exceeding the
          limits set by WHO (Ali et al, 2016). The lead concentrations in some
          crustacean and fish species from Saint Martin in Bangladesh were in
          the carcinogenic ranges (Baki et al, 2018). Across the Karnaphuli
          River and the adjacent coastal areas of Chittagong are the “hotspots”
          containing high polluting concentrations of heavy metals (Kibria et
          al, 2018). Prawn samples from Southeast Bangladesh contained mercury
          and lead with concentrations exceeding max accepted levels specified
          by WHO (Islam et al, 2017). Arsenic concentrations exceeded the
          minimum WHO limits in shallow aquifers of Kushtia, Bangladesh (Huq et
          al, 2019).

          Arsenic has been found to inhibit childhood intelligence by decreasing
          working memory of infants (Wasserman et al, 2016). Arsenic is a
          transition heavy metal and so it can bind to various chemicals that
          are important to running and regulating metabolic pathways keeping an
          organism alive (Mundy, 2015). In addition, Arsenic has the tendency to
          manipulate genetic information which is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of
          any living organism by introducing mutations (Mass et al 2001; Wang et
          al, 2002). Chromium ions in waters stemming from tanneries of
          Hazaribagh, Dhaka, were found to be “synergistically” carcinogenic
          (cancer-causing) (Yoshinaga et al, 2018). High doses of cadmium can
          cause kidney failure and softening of bones (Vannoort & Thomson, 2006)
          in addition to prostate cancer (Gray et al, 2005). Neurodevelopment of
          Bangladeshi children of 2-3 years old can be hampered by increased
          blood lead concentrations stemming from drinking lead contaminated
          water (Rodrigues et al, 2016).
        </div>
        <div className="pStyle">
          Excess amounts of arsenic in water have now become a debilitating
          problem for the civilians of Bangladesh. The population being exposed
          to the arsenic-contaminated groundwater is at an all time high and
          requires immediate attention/action. The civilians of Bangladesh have
          no other option but to drink the potentially contaminated groundwater,
          which raises major health concerns. There have been reports over time
          of individuals affected by arsenic in Bangladesh and surrounding
          areas. It has been discovered that the arsenic contamination is
          extremely high in the tube-wells, which is where majority of the
          population retrieve their water. Arsenic in groundwater poses a huge
          threat to the lives of millions in Bangladesh.

          The measurements of high concentrations of heavy metals in Bangladesh
          waters when seen in conjunction with the health effects of them is
          apparent from the discussion above. Clearly, this discussion suggests
          the need for methodologies aiming to remove these heavy metals from
          waters and to answer that issue there is research going on now to this
          day on removing those heavy metals. In addition, research goes on to
          this day looking for cheap and efficacious methods for removing those
          heavy metals from contaminated Bangladesh waters.
