        As the holy month of Ramadan nears its end, BDP took on a special
        initiative to sponsor Iftaar dinner for a large cohort of poor and
        helpless people. BDP was able to fundraise enough to feed 1000 people
        over a span of FIVE days! Through our trusted connections in Bangladesh,
        we have arranged the seating and Iftar boxes which consist of:
        Rice/Pulao Chicken Roast Piazu (fried onion) 2 Dates Banana Water Jilapi
        What better way to end Ramadan than being able to feed those who do not
        get to enjoy the same luxuries that we do and eat properly to break
        their fast? We are extremely proud of you for supporting us on this very
        important initiative through your generous donations and shoutouts! YOU
        were the ones keeping this initiative alive and allowing this to come to
        fruition. This is a huge milestone for BDP and we wish that you all
        continue to support us in our journey to serve as a beacon of hope for
        our motherland. ✊🏾🇧🇩🙏🏽 #BDPiftaar #dhaka #bangladesh #Ramadan
