        As the holy month of Ramadan nears its end, BDP took on a special
        initiative to sponsor Iftaar dinner for a large cohort of poor and
        helpless people. BDP was able to fundraise enough to feed 1000 people
        over a span of five days. What better way to end Ramadan than being able
        to feed those who do not get to enjoy the same luxuries that we do and
        eat properly to break their fast? We are extremely proud of you for
        supporting us on this very important initiative through your generous
        donations. This is a huge milestone for BDP and we wish that you all
        continue to support us in our journey to serve as a beacon of hope for
        our motherland.
