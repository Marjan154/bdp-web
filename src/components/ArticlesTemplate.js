//     It is not uncommon that women are sold, forced or tricked into prostitution
//     in Bangladesh. However, there are those who never even known of an
//     alternative life. These girls are those who were born into prostitution.
//     Despite there existing laws that forbid child prostitution, they are not
//     upheld and as a result brothels consist of large group of minors. Girls who
//     are unfortunate enough to be born into prostitution have had their lives
//     decided for them at conception. The young girls who were born into
//     prostitution had no opportunity to get an education to prepare for a better
//     life. They have no family to escape to as they are usually birthed from a
//     prostitute and a customer. The government enables the victimization while
//     society shuns the victims. With no money, nowhere to go, and no support from
//     society or a higher institution, they are essentially imprisoned to a life
//     of emotional, sexual, and physical abuse. They are forever branded as
//     “bonded girls”. Unfortunately, the struggle of “bonded girls” does not just
//     end here. Many of them are forced to take body enhancing drugs, the same
//     steroids used to fatten cattle. These drugs make young girls gain weight and
//     curves, despite being severely malnourished and unhealthy. The consequences
//     of these drugs are debilitating, but they are ignored in exchange for better
//     business. In addition to this, the young girls themselves barely make one
//     dollar a day. Those who bear their own children must provide for themselves
//     and their children with this income. If somehow they are able to send their
//     children off to somewhere better, the money they make is rarely enough to
//     provide. If they cannot, their children will then have to live as a
//     prostitute, and the cycle begins again. To make things worse, the blood
//     stained money is often even confiscated from the workers. While these girls
//     are put in an impossible situation, they are by no means weak. When they
//     grow up, many working prostitutes try to protect their children from such a
//     horrible life, and go through extensive measures to give them access to
//     education and isolate them from the brothels. With their collective effort,
//     they will bring the change and freedom that society failed to give them.
