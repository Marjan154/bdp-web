              As young Bangladeshis in the United States, we believe that it is
              imperative to shed light on the injustices imposed on
              underprivileged children in Bangladesh. Unjust labor laws, unequal
              educational opportunities, and healthcare inequities are realities
              that we cannot escape. Let us unite and work diligently to ensure
              that no Bangladeshis are left behind.
