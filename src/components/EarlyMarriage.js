    Bangladesh has the fourth highest rate for early childhood marriages in the
    world. Due to various factors such as cultural values and norms, social
    pressures, and poverty, many girls are married between the ages of 15-16.
    59% of girls are married before age 18, and 22% are married before they are
    even 15 years old.
